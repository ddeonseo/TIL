          A collection of concrete writeups of small things I learn daily while working
          and researching. My goal is to work in public. I was inspired to start this
          repository after reading Simon Wilson's [hacker new post][1], and he was
          apparently inspired by Josh Branchaud's [TIL collection][2].
